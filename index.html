                        <p>
                            Our most recent creation, this little board went around with me most of 2015. I needed something a little more convenient
                            this year, and this board did the trick. I’ll detail out the list of pedals on the board below.
                            <br><br> Pedal order chain goes : IN junction box – Compression – EM Drive – Scarlett Love Overdrive
                            – JHS Prestige – Tap A Whirl – Nano Pog – Junction box mono out/stereo return (bypassed when
                            nothing plugged in) – Strymon Timeline – Neunaber Stereo Wet – Junction box stereo out.
                        </p>

                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">Walrus Audio Deep Six Compressor</a></h3>
                            <p>This is my favorite compression pedal I’ve used. It sounds great, and its controls are easy to
                                use and very effective. This pedal helps give me extra sustain, fattens up my tone, and smooths
                                everything out. Check it out.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">EM Drive</a></h3>
                            <p>Emerson Custom has drive pedals dialed in. This simple two knob guy was great for this board.
                                Its a turn up and go pedal. No tweaking. Just trust it. It has the tone i want for rhythm
                                and warmth every time.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col span-1-of-3 pedal-container">
                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">Scarlett Love Overdrive</a></h3>
                            <p>The Nigel Hendroff signature overdrive pedal. Of course it sounds amazing. I like to describe
                                it as a dark and rich overdrive. You don’t have to work to get a nice smooth top end and
                                natural sounding gain with this pedal.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="row pedals">

                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">JHS Prestige</a></h3>
                            <p>Due to wanting to keep the board compact, I opted out of having a third stage drive and instead
                                went for a compact boost. The Prestige is a great boost. It doesnt add a lot of gain, but
                                simply justs boosts me to where i want to be in the mix, in the moment. This pedal has been
                                a handy little tool.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col span-1-of-3 pedal-container">
                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">Neunaber Stereo Wet</a></h3>
                            <p>This is the best compact reverb pedal I’ve used, and one of the best reverb sounding pedals I’ve
                                used period. While it doesnt have the insane amount of options that a lot of reverb pedals
                                have, I find I dont need the options with this pedal. It sounds fantastic just the way it
                                is. You can adjust tone, length, and amount of verb on the signal, and that’s mostly what
                                settings I need in a reverb anyway. Their handy ExP pedal hooks up to it and allows me to
                                have multiple presets. Usually I have it set up for a “dry always on” setting, and a “heavy
                                crazy verb” setting. Two presets to switch back and forth. Easy to use, sounds fantastic.
                                Dont hesitate on this pedal.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3><a href="#pedal-url">Strymon Timeline</a></h3>
                            <p>I’ve used a lot of digital delay pedals, and really like a lot of them. Seems to do everything
                                that the Eventide TimeFactor did, and more. I mainly just use one delay setting, and store
                                different tempos of the same setting depending on the song. I like this pedal because of
                                the way the Banks and Presets are laid out. Makes it great for playing a live set. Also has
                                a million cool sounds in it. Someday I’ll explore more of this pedal.</p>

                            <p>An octave pedal in a extremely small size. Perfect for tiny tap dancing. It sounds the same as
                                the bigger pog, but it’s smaller. This one is modded by Rick Matthews at www.matthewselectronics.com
                                to have two availabe settings. Two pogs in one, and half the size. Come on now.</p>

                            <p>This is the mono in/stereo out of the board, as well as a mono send (routed just after the pog)
                                and stereo return (routed back into the Timeline) to make a place for stereo effects to be
                                plugged in if ever I wanted to.</p>

                            <p>This is my tremolo pedal. Hand made, analog, and great tone. It has lots of different tremolo
                                settings and a tap tempo, which makes it convenient for live playing.</p>

                        <h3>The Amp :</h3>
                        <p>This amp is amazing.  It has a lot of versatility, tons of headroom on the 50 watt setting, or can break up really nicely and fairly quick on the 12 watt setting.  I love the full range of the amp.. definitely one of my favorite amps i’ve played.  If you’ve never heard one, it has a nice tight high end, huge lows and mids, and has a lot of characteristics of a vintage AC30, but still very unique sounding too.  Definitely well suited for all the guitars that I play.  You can here demo’s of the Britain on their website.  Mine is a sand color with a 2×12 cab.</p>
